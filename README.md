# Development environment

Use this development environment to play & develop with JumpScale.
It uses Docker and the goal is to get it to work on Ubuntu, Windows & Mac OS X.

## JumpScale 9

First execute `jsinit.sh` in order to prepare the installation:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jumpscale/developer/master/jsinit.sh?$RANDOM > $TMPDIR/jsinit.sh; sh $TMPDIR/jsinit.sh
```

Then in order to actually install you need to execute `js9_build`:

```bash
#-l installs extra libs
#-p installs portal
js9_build -l
```

To see all options do ```js9_build -h```

To see interactive output do the following in a separate console:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/lastcommandoutput.txt
```

To see an install watch [this screencast](http://showterm.io/5a87e36aee35b5b765b20#fast).

## JumpScale 8.2

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jumpscale/developer/master/scripts/js_builder_js82_zerotier.sh | bash -s <your-ZeroTier-network-ID>
```

To see interactive output do the following in a separate console:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/lastcommandoutput.txt
```

For more details about using `js_builder_js82_zerotier.sh` see [here](docs/installjs8_details.md).


### Add a G8OS grid to your JumpScale 8.2 development environment

This script is based on the JumpScale 8.2 development environment above:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jumpscale/developer/master/scripts/g8os_grid_installer82.sh | bash -s <Branch> <your-ZeroTier-network-ID> <your-ZeroTier-Token>
```

Again, to see interactive output do the following in separate console:

```
tail -f /tmp/lastcommandoutput.txt
```


## Login into the development machine

JumpScale 9:
```
ssh root@localhost -p 2222
```

JumpScale 8.2:
```
ssh root@zerotier-IP-address
#or
docker exec -it js82 bash
```

## Start with the JumpScale interactive shell

```bash
js
```

 > This will change, is just to get started

## Recommended tools

- All JumpScale code is checked out under `/opt/code` in the development environment or in `~/code/...`
- Use an IDE like Atom for development, SourceTree is a good tool for Git manipulation
- Over SSH you can play with the code in the Docker container
- To push changes to a remote host (remote development) use `j.tools.develop...`

## Other scripts

In `/scripts`:

- `prepare.sh`: execute this to make sure that your local environment is up to date
- `js_builder.sh`: build JumpScale 8 on branch 8.2.0 inside the docker with name js


## Cleanup

```
#remove all old dockers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

## Init tools

```
#sets the initial config
python3 -c "from js9 import j;j.do.initEnv()"
#generates the init list
python3 -c "from JumpScale9 import j;j.tools.jsloader.generate()"
#get a shell now with autogenerated init
python3 -c "from JumpScale.init import j;from IPython import embed;embed()"
```

## Removing Homebrew and /opt on Mac OS X

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jumpscale/developer/master/scripts/osx_reset_all.sh?$RANDOM > $TMPDIR/resetall.sh;bash $TMPDIR/resetall.sh
```
